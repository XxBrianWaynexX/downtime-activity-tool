## Overview
This tool is designed for Dungeons & Dragons 5e campaigns to streamline downtime activities. It allows characters to engage in trade, undertake mini-quests, or train for class-specific experience. The tool generates results dynamically based on input, such as character abilities and selected routes or quests.

- **Charisma Bonuses**: Adds bonuses to gold earned for high charisma scores or charisma-based skills like Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion.

### Mini-Quests
